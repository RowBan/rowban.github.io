I fucked up by creating a Github Pages repository I intended to use for publishing this.
I then proceeded to copy (cp) from "Webbutvecklings-programet / moment4-ht23-RowBan" to my Github Pages repository.
Proceeded to do small changes to the files in order to get the "indexing to work" because I couldn't figure out why it didn't.
Committed and pushed these changes, meaning I pushed this repository into a different one without knowing it because with cp the .git also came along for the ride.

So I reset --hard on commit 5bc4384 and force pushed. Can't see this repository under my profile anymore and do not know how to fix that.
Sucky ducky.
